# Project summary

DNA methylation QTL (methQTL) mapping of the sex chromosome of a chicken population. DNA methylation was measured with [MeDIP-seq](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-020-01310-1). The identified methQTL were overlapped with gene expression QTL (eQTL) identified [previous]() in the same chicken population.
